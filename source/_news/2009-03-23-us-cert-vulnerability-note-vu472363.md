IPv6 Ready Phase-2 Core Test Specification is consistent with US-CERT Vulnerability Note [VU#472363](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/472363).  

US-CERT Vulnerability Note VU#472363 mentioned to block NS with illogical source addresses. And the procedure in the test specification never sends such NS.  

Against this vulnerability, some implementations simply blocks not only the NS but also the NA. Depending on this wrong fix, the implementation fails some tests listed below.  


*   Test v6LC.2.2.19: Router Advertisement Processing, On-link determination (Hosts Only)
*   Test v6LC.2.3.1: Redirected On-link: Valid (Hosts Only)

*   Part A
*   Part B



In the test procedure for these tests, the implementation will receive a NA whose source address has a different prefix from the prefix assigned to the implementation. But this situation can happen also in the real network.  

If the implementaion evaluates such packets in conjunction with on-link determination, the implementation will also be consistent with the RFC.
