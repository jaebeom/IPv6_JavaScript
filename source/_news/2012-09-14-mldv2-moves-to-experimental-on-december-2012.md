The IPv6 Ready Logo Committee would like to announce that the MLDv2 logo program will be moving to experimental on December 1st, 2012.  

The test specifications and test tools will be left on the website for vendor use, however the tools will not be supported by the IPv6 Ready Logo Committee.  

Supplementary information: The MLDv2 Logo (Experimental) will be a short term measure. The IPv6 Ready Logo Committee is currently working on the MLDv2 Logo and will consider the resumption of the logo in the near future.
