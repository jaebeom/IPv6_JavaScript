Global IPv6 Transition InterOp Event

12 – 15, November, 2012 , Beijing

The China IPv6 Council, the BII Group, in co-operation with ETSI, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute and the University of New Hampshire Interoperability Laboratory, will host the 1st Global IPv6 Transition Interop Event in November 12-15, 2012 in Beijing. This 4-days Interop event will evaluate the status of vendor support for the various methods of transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 networks. This event is supported by the IPv6 Forum and the Broadband Forum (BBF).

“Testing transition mechanisms for interoperability is a non-trivial issue” states Latif Ladid, President, IPv6 Forum

“We should have a clear vision on the process and maturity of IPv6 transition for both ISPs and Governments” states Liu Dong, Chair China IPv6 Council and Chair IPv6 enabled Program

“Planning for transition is not enough. ETSI has long recognised the necessity of testing and validation, and devotes significant resources to this through its Plugtests interoperability program.” states Anthony Wiles, Director of ETSI’s Centre for Testing and Interoperability

“This first global IPv6 transition interop event is aimed at validating the different transition mechanisms we have in our tools box and to ensure that these mechanisms do provide the best transition experience for the end user. This is a fundamental step towards global IPv6 deployment.” Says Yanick Pouffary General Chairperson for the IPv6 Logo Programs (Ready & Enabled & Education), IPv6 Forum Fellow and NAv6TF Technology Director.

”It is now time to test our knowledge, skills and transition plans. This next step is important for deployments worldwide as the greatest IPv6 thought leaders in testing come together.” states Erica Johnson, Director, UNH-IOL, IPv6 Ready Logo Regional Officer, IPv6 Forum Fellow, USA

Several methods exist for transitioning between IPv4 and IPv6 networks, such as DS-lite, 6Rd, CGN, IVI, Public 4over6, PNAT etc. This event will focus on testing these methods in end to end configurations. The event will attract network equipment vendors, networking specialists and ISPs who are in the process of transitioning their networks to IPv6.

The goal of this event is to verify the maturity and readiness of IPv6 transition technologies and to promote the transition and adoption of IPv6 worldwide.
