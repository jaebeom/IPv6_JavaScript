The IPv6 Ready Logo Committee would like to announce that applications received on or after July 1, 2013 will be assessed a $500 US dollar examination fee. The Examination lab may choose to waive this fee if the test results were performed at an approved lab as the fee may be covered under testing service fees. We will announce more details later.
