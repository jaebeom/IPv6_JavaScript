DURHAM, N.H.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The University of New Hampshire InterOperability Laboratory (UNH-IOL), an independent provider of broad-based testing and standards conformance services for the networking industry, announced today that four customer edge (CE) routers have been approved for the IPv6 Ready CE Router Logo. Devices from Broadcom, Netgear and ZTE passed the necessary IPv6 test cases, enabling them to bear a mark established by the IPv6 Ready Logo Committee (v6LC). The IPv6 Ready Logo indicates to service providers that IPv6 will work on those models, allowing end users to utilize the new addressing service. Total IPv6 traffic increased dramatically in July 2015, when the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) reported that North America had exhausted its IPv4 addresses. As consumer Internet of Things (IoT) technologies gain traction, a trend on display at CES 2016, IPv6 traffic is expected to continue rising.
