The IPv6 Ready Logo Committee would like to announce that the MIPv6, NEMO, IMS and SIP logo programs are moving to experimental. We will no longer accept logo applications for MIPv6, NEMO, IMS and SIP after March 1, 2012.  

The test specifications and test tools will be left on the website for vendor use, however the tools will not be supported by the IPv6 Ready Logo Committee.  

The MIPv6 Logo holders will remain public on the IPv6 Ready Logo Program Approved List. There are currently no logo holders for NEMO, IMS or SIP.
