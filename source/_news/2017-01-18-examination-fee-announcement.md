**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The IPv6 Ready Logo Committee would like to announce that CE Router applications received will be assessed a $1500 US dollar examination fee and all other applications will be assessed a $500 US dollar examination fee. The Examination lab may choose to waive this fee if the test results were performed at an approved lab as the fee may be covered under testing service fees.
