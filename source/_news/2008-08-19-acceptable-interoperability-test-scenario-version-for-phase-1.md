This is an announcement about the Phase-1 interoperability test.

Till the last major version up of the IPv6 Ready Logo Test Specification, Phase-1 had 2 version of interoperability test scenario. One was IPv6Ready_PhaseII_Base_Interop_version_2_8_4.pdf on www.ipv6ready.org and the other was IPv6Ready_P1_interop_1-3-3.pdf on www.tahi.org.

But after the last major version up at May 30th 2008, only IPv6Ready_Base_Interop_version_4_0_0.pdf and IPv6Ready_PhaseII_Base_Interop_version_2_8_4.pdf are available now. In addition, IPv6Ready_Base_Interop_version_4_0_0.pdf is the main version and IPv6Ready_PhaseII_Base_Interop_version_2_8_4.pdf will be obsoleted at Nov. 30th. If you are planning to obtain phase-1 logo, please don't use IPv6Ready_P1_interop_1-3-3.pdf for executing the new test.

And if you already tested with IPv6Ready_P1_interop_1-3-3.pdf, please submit the application within one month from now. We will accept IPv6Ready_P1_interop_1-3-3.pdf until Sep. 19th.
