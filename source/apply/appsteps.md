## Outline to obtain the Logo

The following is the process for obtaining the IPv6 Ready Logo. The tested product needs to pass 100% each of the appropriate conformance and interoperability test assertions.

1. Download the [IPv6 Ready Logo Test Specification](./technical-info.html).

2. Either download the self-testing tools and interoperability test scenarios and execute them against your product; or submit your product to one of the IPv6 Ready Logo approved laboratories for testing.

3. Gather the complete test result log from either 1) the self-testing tool and interoperability test you conducted or 2) an IPv6 Ready testing laboratory. (If you are a participant of an interoperability test event, you may use the event test logs at the event as the interoperability test log).

4. Please access the [Online Application Form](https://www.ipv6ready.org/db/index.php/form/).

5. Select the Application Type: New application and continue to fill out the Application Form. (Please fill out the form in English).

6. Next, review your information and Confirm the Application.

7. Then, upload your test results<sup>&dagger;</sup> as one archive file using the following syntax: (Vendor Name)\_(Product Name)\_(Product Version).tar.gz and confirm the upload by clicking the Next button.

8. Then Select the Examination Lab that you wish to review your results by using the drop down menu.

9. Once submitted, an email will be sent to you as a confirmation and it will also include your Application ID. Please note - you must confirm the **IPv6 Ready Logo Usage Agreement using the link in the email prior the application review.**

10. Once the Usage Agreement has been confirmed, please wait for the examination lab to start the review. The examination lab may charge $500 USD for reviewing your application and will bill you directly. Some examination labs may waive this fee if it was covered under their testing services. Please inquire with them.

11. You may refer to the [How to apply via Online application form](https://www.ipv6ready.org/db/index.php/form/) regarding checking, selecting a new examination lab or resubmitting your application.

12. The IPv6 Ready Logo Examiner on the IPv6 Ready Logo Technical Group will contact you in order to guide the examination process of your application.

13. If the applicant does not get any response within 1 month, please send mail to **ipv6ready-info \[ a t \] ipv6ready.org** (English Only Please).

14. After review by the IPv6 Ready Logo Technical Group, if the tested product passes 100% of the appropriate conformance and interoperability test assertions the IPv6 Forum Logo Committee assigns a Logo ID and authorize the usage of the IPv6 Ready Logo.

15. Approved information of this application will be put on the [approval website](https://www.ipv6ready.org/db/index.php/public/?o=6).

16. To update the information of an approved product (i.e. version no.), please send the following information to **v6-appli \[ a t \] ipv6ready.org**. For security reasons, we will email the original contact person as stated on the original application. The new information will be subscribed to the database, only when confirmed.
