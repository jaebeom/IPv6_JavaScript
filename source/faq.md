### 1. What is the IPv6 Ready Logo Program?

The IPv6 Ready Logo program is an international testing program intended to increase user confidence by demonstrating that IPv6 is currently available for today's deployment and use.

The key objective and benefit of the IPv6 Ready Logo program is three fold;

* Verify protocol implementation and validate interoperability of IPv6 products.
* Provide access to free self-testing tools.
* Provide IPv6 Ready Logo testing laboratories across the globe dedicated to provide testing assistance or services.

<a name="head2"></a>
### 2. What is the IPv6 Forum's role?

The IPv6 Forum plays a major role to bring together industrial actors, to develop and deploy the new generation of IP protocols, IPv6. The IPv6 Forum created the IPv6 Ready Logo Committee in 2002 to manage this globally unique logo program.

There is no membership requirement for obtaining the IPv6 Ready Logo since the IPv6 Forum is an open, international Forum of IPv6 experts.

<a name="head3"></a>

<a name="head5"></a>
### 5. Are there different Phases of the IPv6 Ready Logo Program?

The IPv6 Forum strongly encourages vendors to obtain the IPv6 Ready Logo Phase-2. The Phase-2 Logo verifies optimum compliance because of the complete series of tests including the "MUST" and the recommended "SHOULD" for the IETF specifications tested.

The Phase-2 Gold Logo (since February 15, 2005) indicates that a product has successfully satisfied strong requirements as stated by the IPv6 Ready Logo Committee (v6LC). The Phase-2 IPv6 core test coverage includes approximately 450 tests.

The Phase-1 Silver Logo was deprecated in September 2011 in order to harmonize with the higher quality and certification standards. Please read the [press release](http://www.v6pc.jp/jp/pdf/101201_PressRelease_en.pdf) for more information.

### 9. How often do these test documents change?

Updates to the IPv6 Ready Logo program test specifications and test tools are done according to the IPv6 Ready Logo Program "IPv6 Ready Logo Committee Test Suite Maintenance Procedure Document Latest". The document introduces the concept of "Major version", "Major revision" and "Minor revision". "Major version" updates occurs when an RFC has been revised or when additional tests coverage are introduced that changes the compatibility with the previous version, and "minor revision" updates can be assimilated to normal maintenance of the document (bug fixes for example). If there are no urgent releases required, updates to the document occur in May and November of each year (every 6 months).

Once a new Major Version test specification is released, the applicant has a grace period of 6 months to continue using the former test specification. This is to ensure proper notice for implementers to abide by the new test specification. Likewise, applicants have a grace period of 4 weeks after the release of a Major Revision or Minor Revision to continue to use the former test specifications.

Please refer to the [IPv6 Maintenance Agreement Document](docs/v6LC_Test_Specification_Maintenance_Procedure_latest.pdf)

### 10. What is the process to obtain the IPv6 Ready Logo?

The process for obtaining the IPv6 Ready Logo is referenced below. The tested product needs to pass 100% each of the appropriate conformance and interoperability test assertions.

* [Phase-2 Application Procedure](apply/appsteps.html)

<a name="head11"></a>
### 11. What is the format of the IPv6 Ready Logo?

#### The Logo ID format is as follows:

`{Phase(2digits)}-{[additional_info]}-{serial_number(6digits)}`

Phase: "02"<br>
additional_info: Variable length.<br>
Each character indicates an extended test category.<br>
Each character can be combined.<br>
C: for IPv6 Core Protocol<br>
S: for IPsec<br>
M: for MIPv6<br>
N: for NEMO<br>
D: for DHCPv6<br>
P: for SIP<br>
E: for CE Router<br>
serial_number : World wide unique serial number (6 digits)<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
Phase-2 Logo ID for core 02-C-000123.<br>
Phase-2 Logo ID for core, IPsec MIPv6 02-CSM-000123

<a name="head12"></a>
### 12. Do I have to re-test my product after a software/hardware version update?

Yes, If a new product version changes the networking IPv6 stack, the IPv6 Ready Logo Committee requires that the applicant reruns and resubmits both conformance and interoperability tests logs if the new product is to continue to use the already assigned IPv6 Ready Logo ID.

No, If the new product version does not change the network stack, vendor can update the registered version by submitting a request to update the version number as per the [Application Procedure](apply/appsteps.html) Step 10.

**Important:** The IPv6 Ready Logo Committee reserves the right to request for more information from vendors as required. If needed the IPv6 Ready Logo Committee can ask the vendors to re-run the test and submit the test logs.

<a name="head13"></a>
### 13. Can I get the Logo for a series of products?

Yes, if a series of products uses identical networking stack, that product series will be accepted with one application, on condition that the network stack is identical across the product family and that it is clearly stated in the application form.

**Important:** The IPv6 Ready Logo Committee reserves the right to request for more information from vendors as required. If needed the IPv6 Ready Logo Committee can ask the vendors to re-run the test and submit the test logs.

<a name="head14"></a>
### 14. Do I need to re-test when my product uses an already approved OEM product?

OEM Licensor can extend its IPv6 Ready Logo ID to OEM Licensee. OEM Licensee can register its product with IPv6 Ready Logo Committee without testing as long as there is a one to one IPv6 stack transfer is certified by OEM Licensor. At this time, Applicant must specify the original product name and Logo ID on the bottom of the application form.

The associated OEM Logo ID is always stated on the Logo website as part of their approval. This means that the applicant would have their own accepted Logo ID public on the website.

If the OEM licensee does not wish to make this agreement known and wish to obtain its own IPv6 Ready Logo ID, they must run and submit both conformance and interoperability tests logs as for any products.

<a name="head15"></a>
### 15. Where can I find the test specifications/tools?

All of the test specifications and self-test tools can be found on the the [Phase 2 Technical Information Page.](resources.html)

<a name="head16"></a>
### 16. Who can I contact if I need help testing?

Please refer to the [contact page.](contact.html)

<a name="head17"></a>
### 17. Does it cost anything to apply for the Logo?

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The IPv6 Ready Logo Committee would like to announce that CE Router applications received will be assessed a $1500 US dollar examination fee and all other applications will be assessed a $500 US dollar examination fee. The Examination lab may choose to waive this fee if the test results were performed at an approved lab as the fee may be covered under testing service fees.

<a name="head18"></a>
### 18. Where can I get the list of IPv6 Ready Logo Approved Products?

The lists of products approved for the IPv6 Ready Logo are published on the IPv6 Ready Logo Web page.

* [Phase 2 Approved List](https://www.ipv6ready.org/phase-2_approved_list)

<a name="head19"></a>
### 19. If I test at one approved lab, will the Logo results be accepted globally?

The IPv6 Ready Logo is accepted globally. The test results may be collected by utilizing self test tools or by using an approved laboratory. The Logo approval is performed through committee review processes and does not note where testing is performed. Once approved, the IPv6 Ready Logo does not require testing at multiple locations.
